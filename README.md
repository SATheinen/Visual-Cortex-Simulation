Showcase of my results from my Master Thesis

![Cortical Wave Animation](grating_new.mp4)

Spatiotemporal neural dynamics in macaque visual cortex (Layer 4A/B, 16mm²). 
Shows population-level spiking waves emerging from retina-processed thalamic signals.

From my master's thesis on biologically realistic edge detection in V1.
